## cyber-rogue

Yet another roguelike project made for fun.
Currently there's basic engine and gameplay loop.

Play latest build here: https://rr-adam.github.io/cyber-rogue/play

## How it works

The game is made with Svelte.
Game logic is connected with components through a store.
All tiles, entities and effects are actual Svelte components.
